Description:
------------
This module extends the webform module to easily allow submitting a webform 
to SalesForce.com.  It utilizes the SalesForce API, which must be downloaded
separately from the module.  It can be downloaded freely from
http://wiki.apexdevnet.com/index.php/Web_Services_API#PHP
under the 'Toolkit' listing.  Make sure you follow the instructions on the
project page or the INSTALL.TXT file very closely to make sure the API is 
installed correctly.

The SalesForce Webform module does require PHP with SOAP enabled.

This module was sponsored by by Davis Applied Technology College, 
http://www.datc.edu.  The module was programmed by Obsidian Design LLP,
http://www.obsidiandesign.com.

The module is based, in part, on the sugarwebform module.
