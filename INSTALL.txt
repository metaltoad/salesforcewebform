Requirements
------------
Drupal 6.x, Salesforce.com account, PHP + SOAP enabled, Webform 3.x, Webform PHP


Upgrading
------------
Always make sure to run update.php when upgrading the module to a new version

If you are upgrading from the 1.x to the 2.x branch, check to make sure that
the field mappings are maintained.  Users moving from the 1.2->2.0 editions
may have fields that do not remained mapped due to a change in the way
Salesforce Webform handles the mappings.


Installation
------------
1. Copy the salesforcewebform directory to the Drupal modules directory for your site

2. Download the latest version of the Salesforce PHP Toolkit (Version 20.0 at the time of
   writing) from http://wiki.apexdevnet.com/index.php/Web_Services_API#PHP under
   'Toolkits'.

3. Unzip the contents of the toolkit's phptoolkit-20_0 folder into the salesforcewebform/includes directory.

4. Login as an administrator. Enable the module in the "Administer" -> "Build" -> "Modules"

5. Go to "Administer" -> "site configuration" -> "Salesforce Webform"
  
   In the 'Path to Salesforce PHP Toolkit' textfield,  enter the absolute path to the 
   phptoolkit folder that you've uploaded.
   
   If you have custom fields defined in your object (Account, Contact, or Lead) form, 
   enter them into the 'Custom Fields' box.  Enter in the format key|description.  To find
   the correct key name, in your Salesforce.com page, go to "Setup" -> "App Setup" -> 
   "Customize" -> "Leads" -> "Fields".  Select the field, and note the "API Field Name".  
   That is the key you need to list on the Custom Fields page.

   Enter a valid Salesforce username.

   Enter the corresponding password + API Security token, in the form passwordXXXXXXXX,
   where 'password' is the account password and xxxxxxxx is the API Security Token.
   
   Make sure to check the 'Change Login Information' box so that the login information is
   stored in the database.

   Save the configuration.  Note that the password will not display (for security reasons),
   but is stored in the database.

6. In your Salesforce.com screen, add a new custom field 'WebformSID'.  Select that it is
   a Unique Field and an External ID.  It is very important to add this field, as it
   maps each Webform submission to an object in Salesforce, and allows edits of the Webform
   submission to not create a duplicate object; instead, the existing object is updated.

7. Create or edit a webform to match your object form.  Under 'Salesforce Settings', select
   the 'Yes' option to post the form to Salesforce.

   Make sure that, at a minimum, that your webform contains the minimum required fields from
   the Salesforce Account, Contact, or Lead form.
   
   Under 'Form Settings' when editing the Webform, add the following code for 'Additional Processing':

	<?php
	require_once(drupal_get_path('module', 'salesforcewebform') . '/salesforcewebform.module');
	$form_state = salesforcewebform_process($node, $form, $form_state);
	?>

   For each component, you must select a Salesforce field to map to.  The default fields
   are listed for easy mapping.  Custom fields must be entered into the "Administer" ->
   "Site Configuration" -> "Salesforce Webform" screen.

   As the last entry in the Webform, add a hidden field 'SID Key'.  Select 'Webform SID Key'
   as the Salesforce key to map to.  It is very important that the SID Key be the LAST item in
   the form.

   Save the webform.

8. As your object form is submitted (either new or edits), it will be posted via SOAP to 
   Salesforce automatically.
